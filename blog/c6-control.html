        <h3>Programming Triggers</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="question">When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</span><br>
            Firstly, most of my programming has been solo. In my experience, many of my triggers come from other people. I have also taught programming. The teacher-student relationship is different in that it is also a power relationship. From an educational perspective, the main trigger would be students who do not make an effort to write programs and to learn. <br><br>
            Where I&rsquo;m the programmer, working alone, I invest a lot of myself in my work. I get annoyed when something I have been working on does not run properly. Also, it irritates me when there are parts of a program that I do not understand.<br><br>
            I now realise that when I start the bootcamp, I will be working closely with others. As with the kitchen/restaurant analogy for the bootcamp experience, in the kitchen there needs to be a lot of give and take. The experience of reading and reflecting on <em>Search Inside Yourself</em> will make me more aware of my triggers and how I can better respond to them.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Siberian North Railroad</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="question">How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</span><br>
            The Siberian North Railroad exercise asks you to bring to mind an unhappy event or an experience in which you were triggered. For me, this happened earlier this year. A number of my friends joke about me being a teacher and the excessive holidays we have to endure. I had spent the entire mid-year break (two weeks) writing subject reports. I had been at school nearly every day of the break. I was desperately in need of the holiday, but it had not eventuated. When a friend made a crack about the school holidays, I reacted instinctively to this trigger and said some things that offended my friend and his wife. It was several months before I saw them again and was able to apologise.<br><br>
            Believe it or not, I still have or had some residual emotion from this experience. The exercise helped me to let that go. In future, I have to notice when I am being triggered and to respond mindfully, not instinctively: with a fight or flight reaction.
