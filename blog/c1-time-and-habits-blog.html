  <h1>Time and Habits</h1>
  <blockquote cite="https://www.lifeoptimizer.org/2007/03/08/66-best-quotes-on-time-management/">
    The common man is not concerned about the passage of time,<br>the man of talent is driven by it.
    <cite>Arthur Schopenhauer (1788&ndash;1860) German Philosopher</cite>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</strong><br>Meditation: I downloaded the Headspace app and I plan to try this for the next 10 days.</li>
    <li><strong>What did you find interesting?</strong><br>Flow: <span class="dotted" title="I even know how to pronounce his name!"> Mihály Csíkszentmihályi's</span> work formed part of my Master's Thesis. There are things that teachers and workers can do to engender flow states.</li>
    <li><strong>What worked for you?</strong><br>Something that resonated with me was the idea that <em>it's easier to create a new habit when we do it at the same time each day.</em> That has worked for me in the past. I've also been reading about the importance of having a routine every morning to set yourself up for the day. Obviously, each person's routine will differ, depending on their circumstances. This is something I want to work on.</li>
    <li><strong>Which will you experiment further with?</strong><br>The Pomodoro Technique: I'd heard of this before and I plan to start using it. Also, I liked Fogg's tiny habits. I plan to watch/read the material there again and see if I can make use of some of those ideas.</li>
