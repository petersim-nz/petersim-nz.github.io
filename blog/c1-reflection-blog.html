  <ul>
    <li><span class="question">What&rsquo;s your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</span><br>It&rsquo;s a different way of learning. It&rsquo;s also obvious that I&rsquo;m only going to gain from this what I&rsquo;m prepared to put in.
    </li>
    <li><span class="question">What are your impressions?</span><br>It&rsquo;s going to be really hard work, and really demanding.
    </li>
    <li><span class="question">How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</span><br>I liked the kitchen metaphor in the video. I&rsquo;m going to push myself to look at how I can contribute to the whole learning experience.
    </li>
    <li><span class="question">Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</span><br>Not that much. I went to &ldquo;A Day in the Life&rdquo; in Auckland, plus I&rsquo;ve talked with a graduate. I think those things have helped me to prepare.
    </li>
    <li><span class="question">Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</span><br>Definitely excited. I think there's always a fear of the unknown and how I'm going to be able to measure up. Bring it on!
