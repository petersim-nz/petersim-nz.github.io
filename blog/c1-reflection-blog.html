  <ul>
    <li><strong>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</strong><br>It's a different way of learning. It's also obvious that I'm only going to gain from this what I'm prepared to put in.
    </li>
    <li><strong>What are your impressions?</strong><br>It's going to be really hard work, and really demanding.
    </li>
    <li><strong>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</strong><br>I liked the kitchen metaphor in the video. I'm going to push myself to look at how I can contribute to the whole learning experience.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</strong><br>Not that much. I went to "A Day in the Life" in Auckland, plus I've talked with a graduate. I think those things have helped me to prepare.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</strong><br>Definitely excited. I think there's always a fear of the unknown and how I'm going to be able to measure up. Bring it on!
    </li>
