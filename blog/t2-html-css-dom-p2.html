  <h2>Web Structure</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="question">What is grid based design?</span><br>Screen layout is determined by a series of rows and columns which form a grid.
    </li>
    <li><span class="question">What&rsquo;s all the hype about responsive webpages?</span><br>People use different sized devices (screens) to access the Internet. Webpages should adapt their content to suit the users&rsquo; screen sizes.
    </li>
    <li><span class="question">What is semantic structure?</span><br>Semantics is all about meaning. Tags like &lt;h1&gt; or &lt;nav&gt; have a lot more meaning for humans than do tags such as &lt;div&gt; or &lt;span&gt; which give no clues as to their contents.
    </li>
    <li><span class="question">Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</span><br>I hadn&rsquo;t thought much about <strong>adaptive design</strong> before. People with tablets or phones are using their thumbs instead of a mouse for navigation and this has implications for the way elements should be laid out.
