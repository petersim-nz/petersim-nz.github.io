  <h2>Web Structure</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="question">Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</span><br>A good analogy is the human body. The HTML in a webpage is like a skeleton, a framework which supports everything else. CSS is about styling and appearance, so it&rsquo;s skin deep and might include hairstyles, tattoos and body art as well as jewellery and clothing. The DOM (Document Object Model) is a plan or blueprint for how everything is connected. You need the DOM in order to Add, Modify, Delete or just Inspect any part of a website. With the human body analogy, think of diagnostic medical tools such as MRI, X-Rays or Ultra-Sound that reveal the internal structure.
    </li>
    <li><span class="question">What is meant by boxifying design?</span><br>On a webpage, all the elements (headings, images, text, links) are rectangular in shape. Web design is about arranging these boxes.
    </li>
    <li><span class="question">What is the box model?</span><br>The box model describes the different parts that make up a box on a webpage. At the centre is the content which has a width and a height; this is surrounded by layers of padding, borders and margins.
    </li>
